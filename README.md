# Composable Module: Profile (first draft)

Simple implementation for a composable module for [Fast Floward Bootcamp W3Q3](https://github.com/decentology/ff-empty-registry-demo), based on [ff-empty-registry-demo](https://github.com/decentology/ff-empty-registry-demo).

## Description

As a developer you could use this module to provide profile functionality in your dapp. At the moment you can set and read a username. 
The following fields could also be implemented, for example:

* Picture
* City
* Country
* Links to traditional Web2 profiles (Social media, Medium, GitHub, ...)
* Organizations
* Skills
* Interests
* ...
